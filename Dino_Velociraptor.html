                <p>Velociraptor lived in what's now called the Gobi Desert in Mongolia—it's one of the few places on Earth that has nearly 
                    the same habitat now as it did during the time of the dinosaurs. In addition to larger dinos, this small carnivore 
                    likely also snacked on little lizards, mammals, dino eggs, and baby dinosaurs. It might've even eaten other baby Velociraptors. 
                    Scientists named this dino using the Greek words meaning “quick thief” for the way it might have stolen its meals.</p>
                <p>Experts think Velociraptor was probably one of the smarter dinosaurs because it has a large brain in proportion to its body size. 
                    And based on the size of the part of the skull that holds the scent-processing part of the brain, experts think Velociraptor 
                    had an excellent sense of smell.</p>
                <p><b>Feathered friend</b></p>                
                <p>Recent research on one of the species, Velociraptor mongoliensis, has found that Velociraptor was a feathered dinosaur. 
                    But it couldn't fly—its forelimbs were too short. Instead, the plumage might've been used to keep it warm and attract 
                    mates, just as modern birds use their colorful feathers. Also like birds, Velociraptor had hollow bones and tended nests of eggs.</p>
