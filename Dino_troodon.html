                <p>Troodon is named for the Greek words meaning “wound tooth” because some of its teeth were razor-sharp. However, this dino 
                    had several different shapes of teeth, which probably allowed it to eat different types of food. That included small mammals 
                    and lizards, and perhaps young duck-billed dinosaurs like Amurosaurus. It's possible that Troodon was even omnivorous—meaning 
                    it ate both animals and plants—like humans are.</p>
                <p>This sharped-tooth animal was a good parent. Paleontologists think Troodon produced a pair of eggs at a time, then buried them 
                    partway in mud. The dinosaur would come back and sit on the eggs to keep them warm.</p>
                <p><b>Brain frame</b></p>                             
                <p>Troodon's big brain gave it good eyesight, keen hearing, and a strong sense of smell, which all helped the predator outwit its prey. 
                    And some experts think it might've sometimes hunted in packs to take down large prey—now that's smart.</p>
