                <p>A member of the sauropod group—four-legged plant-eaters with long necks and long tails—Apatosaurus lived alongside other 
                    giant herbivores like Diplodocus, Barosaurus, Brachiosaurus, and Camarasaurus during the late Jurassic Period, between 
                    about 156 million and 151 million years ago. How did all of these dinosaurs share the same food sources? Experts think 
                    perhaps different sizes of dinosaurs ate at different levels of the forest trees.</p>
                <p>This dino is named for the Greek words meaning “deceptive lizard” because at the time, scientists thought that some of 
                    its bones looked like those of mosasaurs, aquatic reptiles related to snakes and lizards that aren’t actually dinosaurs.</p>
                <p><b>Massive mix-up</b></p>                
                <p>Apatosaurus is a lot like its close relative Brontosaurus (which means “thunder lizard” in Greek). Until 2015, these dinos 
                    were thought to be so similar that scientists wanted to give them the same name. (Apatosaurus was the winner because it 
                    was named first.) But today scientists think that Brontosaurus is its own type of dinosaur.</p>
