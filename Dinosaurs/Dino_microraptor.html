                <p>Microraptor, which means “small thief” in Greek, gets its name from being the smallest known species of raptor dinosaurs, 
                    or dinosaurs with birdlike qualities. It's also currently the smallest of all known dinosaurs, weighing about two pounds 
                    and only a foot tall. But with a new species discovered on average every week, that could change!</p>
                <p>This dinosaur had flight feathers on both its front and back limbs, and it had long upper arm bones similar to those seen 
                    in today's birds. It also had a fan of feathers on its tail that it might have used to steer as it coasted to the ground. 
                    Scientists have discovered that its feathers were iridescent, meaning they had a metallic shine similar to the feathers of 
                    modern peacocks and hummingbirds.</p>
                <p><b>Fossilized feathers</b></p>                
                <p>Scientists can study Microraptor's feathers because their impressions were preserved in rocks as fossils. But Microraptor isn't 
                    the only feathered glider: Archaeopteryx, another gliding dinosaur, existed about 25 million years earlier, and Anchiornis Huxleyi 
                    might be even older.</p>             
                <p>Dinosaurs with birdlike qualities like these lived alongside other feathered dinosaurs that couldn't fly at all, like Velociraptor. 
                    But the only dinosaurs that survived the asteroid that hit Earth 66 million years ago were avian dinosaurs—birds!</p>
