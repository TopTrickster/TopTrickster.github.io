                <p>Named for its seven-foot-long spines, Spinosaurus lived about a hundred million years ago during the Cretaceous period. 
                    It inhabited what is now North Africa's Sahara region, which at the time featured a large river system. Spinosaurus was 
                    well adapted for aquatic life. Its nostrils were further up on its snout than the nostrils of other dinosaurs. This would'
                    ve allowed the animal to breathe even with most of its snout submerged. Its crocodile-like teeth were ideal for catching fish.</p>
                <p>Researchers believe the reptile's dense bones—which resemble those of modern-day aquatic creatures such as the manatee—acted as a 
                    weight to help it easily dive into the water while hunting for fish. And its paddle-like webbed feet would've allowed the animal to 
                    swim. Even the dinosaur's sail—which likely stuck out of the water while Spinosaurus was swimming—helped the animal survive in its river home.</p>
                <p><b>Set sail</b></p>                
                <p>Scientists believe that Spinosaurus may have used its sail as a warning signal to intruders. The sight of the sail jutting out of the water would 
                    tell others to back off—unless they wanted a fight. You wouldn't want to mess with this splashy creature!</p>
