                <p>Although it might appear dangerous, Triceratops was actually a slow-moving herbivore that used its beak-like jaw and 
                    slicing teeth to pluck and chew tough plants that other dinosaurs couldn't eat. It roamed in what's now western 
                    North America during the Cretaceous period, about 69 million years ago.</p>
                <p>Its name comes from the Greek words meaning “three-horned face” because of the two horns on its brow and smaller horn 
                    above its mouth. The size and shape of the horns changed so much as the dinosaur aged that scientists first thought 
                    fossils of young and old Triceratops were two different species. (Some adult Triceratops skulls are 10 feet long!)</p>
                <p>Paleontologists are still gathering evidence to learn why Triceratops had those big horns and frills. But because 
                    both males and females had them, experts think that the dinos might've used the giant body parts to impress each 
                    other. (That's not always the case: Female Indian peafowl, for example, are brown while the males, called peacocks, 
                    have a spectacular fan of colored feathers.) Because both of the partners were trying to impress each other, it might 
                    mean that these animals shared some parenting duties.</p> 
                <p><b>Most-found fossil</b></p>                
                <p>This dino lived alongside Tyrannosaurus rex, but both species—and all the other non-avian dinosaurs (meaning dinos that 
                    weren't birds)—went extinct when an asteroid hit Earth 66 million years ago. Today, Triceratops is one of the most-found 
                    fossils, which is good news for dino lovers: It means scientists can use new technology to examine lots of fossils and find 
                    new answers about these animals.</p>
