            <div class="dino-text"><b>Hogwarts dino</b>
                <p>The skull is covered in spikes and horns, and much flatter than other thickheaded dinosaurs. Scientists haven't seen 
                    a fossilized skull quite like this one before, so they put it on display for museum visitors to help name it. 
                    The spiky creature reminds people of dragons from fantasy books and movies, especially the Harry Potter series. 
                    So scientists named the dinosaur Dracorex hogwartsia, which means “dragon king of Hogwarts,” after the magical school.</p>
                <p>But this dino isn't as scary as it appears—it was a plant-eater, and those spikes might've helped fight back against predators or win a mate.</p>
                <p><b>Just a youngster?</b></p>                
                <p>Other scientists disagree that Dracorex is its own species. Instead they think that it could be a young Pachycephalosaurus. As the juvenile dino 
                    grew into an adult, its headgear would have changed shape.</p>             
                <p>Even if Dracorex isn't a separate species, it probably won't lose its special name. But it would help scientists learn a lot more about 
                    how dinosaurs grew up!</p>
