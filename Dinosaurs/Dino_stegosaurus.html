            <div class="dino-text"><b>Puzzling plates</b>
                <p>Stegosaurus is famous for its two rows of kite-shaped plates that stick out from its neck, back, and tail. 
                    But the paleontologist who first discovered a Stegosaurus fossil thought the plates laid flat on its back 
                    like a turtle's shell. That's why its name in Greek means “roof lizard.”</p>
                <p>So why does Stegosaurus have these plates? Some scientists think they were used to attract mates, similar 
                    to the frill on a Triceratops. Others think the plates protected Stegosaurus from attacking predators or 
                    absorbed heat from the sun to help warm the animal. Although the plates are still a mystery, fossilized 
                    footprints reveal that this dino likely traveled in family groups.</p>
                <p>Experts think that Stegosaurus's tail was its main method of defense. The dino could swing its large tail 
                    from side to side with great force. A fossilized tailbone of Allosaurus has a hole in it the size of a 
                    Stegosaurus tail spike—ouch!</p>
                <p><b>Butt brain?</b></p>                
                <p>Stegosaurus lived about 145 million years ago during the Jurassic period in what's now Colorado, Utah, 
                    and Wyoming. It was about the length of a bus and weighed almost 14,000 pounds. But this enormous 
                    animal had a brain that was only slightly larger than a walnut. </p>             
                <p>One early paleontologist believed that Stegosaurus had a second brain in its tail because the expert 
                    noticed a cavity like those where the brain would be in its rump. But that's a busted myth—the empty space 
                    likely held a mass of tissue that might have helped produce extra energy or was simply a fluid-filled gland. </p>
