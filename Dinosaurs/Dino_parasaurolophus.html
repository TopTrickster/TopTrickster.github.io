                <p>This dino grew to be about 33 feet from snout to tail, and its crested skull was over five feet long. 
                    That curved, bony crest puzzled scientists in the past: Some thought it might be a super sniffer, or 
                    something like a snorkel to breathe while underwater. Turns out, the crest was a noisemaker.</p>
                <p>Scientists made the discovery by examining the tubelike holes inside the crest. One paleontologist 
                    created a replica using plastic pipes he could blow into—and out came a trumpetlike B-flat note. 
                    Scientists still aren't sure if Parasaurolophus used its sounds for defense, attracting mates, 
                    communicating with the herd, or all of these.</p>
                <p><b>Not-quite-right name</b></p>                
                <p>This dino's name means “like Saurolophus,” which is another crested dinosaur. (Saurolophus means “lizard crest.”) 
                    But it turns out these two aren't that similar: Saurolophus's headgear was solid; Parasaurolophus's crest was hollow. 
                    So experts believe they used them for different reasons.</p>             
                <p>However, both animals are part of a group of herbivorous (or plant-eating) dinosaurs called duckbills because of the flat 
                    shape of their mouth bones. But that's also not exactly right: These animals had shovel-shaped beaks—not bills—for 
                    snipping off pieces of tough plants like evergreens and ferns. They also had teeth in their cheeks chewing and grinding the plant matter.</p>
