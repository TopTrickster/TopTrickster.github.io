                <p>Experts aren't sure if Allosaurus always hunted live prey—including giant plant-eaters like Apatosaurus—or if 
                    it sometimes scavenged dead or dying animals. Either way, Allosaurus was built to eat meat. Recent research 
                    on dino skulls found that Allosaurus could open its jaw so wide that it might've sometimes slashed its toothy 
                    upper jaw at prey, like a sharp knife. Then once it was time to grab a bite, Allosaurus likely ripped off pieces 
                    of meat by yanking its head backward, similar to how falcons and other raptors dine. Paleontologists have even 
                    found an Allosaurus bite mark on the neck plate of a Stegosaurus.</p>
                <p>Allosaurus lived about 145 million years ago, during the Jurassic period. Part of the theropod family—a group 
                    of dinosaurs that ran on two feet—this dino could grow up to 40 feet from head to tail, about the size of 
                    Tyrannosaurus rex (though most Allosaurus fossils are about 28 feet long). But T. rex, which lived about 
                    76 million years later, had puny arms compared to Allosaurus' forelimbs: Experts think it used its strong 
                    arms and clawed hands to hold struggling prey.</p>
                <p><b>Strange reptile</b></p>                
                <p>The name Allosaurus comes from Greek words meaning “strange reptile.” Why? When the fossils were first discovered 
                    in the 1870s, the small bones forming the backbone were shaped like hourglasses, and that was different from 
                    other dinosaur spines that scientists had examined at that time.</p>             
                <p>Fossils of Allosaurus have been found in Colorado, Utah (where it's the state fossil), Wyoming, and Montana, 
                    as well as in the countries of Tanzania and Germany.</p>
